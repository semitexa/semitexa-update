# Minimal PHP + Swoole for Semitexa (project is mounted at runtime)
#
# PCOV is installed but DISABLED by default (zz-pcov.ini). Coverage is opt-in:
#   php -d pcov.enabled=1 vendor/bin/phpunit <paths> --coverage-text
#
# PCOV rather than Xdebug deliberately: Xdebug is known to conflict with Swoole
# coroutines, which is this framework's entire runtime, and PCOV is far cheaper on
# a large suite. Enabled by default it would make every ordinary test run pay for
# coverage nobody asked for.
#
# pcov.directory is the COLLECTION BOUNDARY and it is the setting that matters:
# left empty, PCOV records nothing and a run completes cleanly reporting 0.00% over
# thousands of classes, with no error and no warning. Isolated by measurement -
# with the directory set, coverage works even at the default initial.files=64;
# with it empty, no value of initial.files helps.
#
# pcov.initial.files only sizes PCOV's internal table up front, so a large suite
# does not reallocate while collecting. It has no effect on WHAT is covered.
#
# vendor/ and tests are excluded so the table is not filled with files no coverage
# report is about.

# Node, as a SEPARATE layer on purpose: it lands after the Swoole build above, so
# adding or changing it re-uses that cached layer instead of recompiling Swoole.
#
# It exists for the server/client render parity test in semitexa-ssr.
# semitexa-twig.js renders deferred slots in the browser while PHP Twig renders
# them on the server, and the only honest way to prove the two agree is to execute
# both on the same input. Without node the test SKIPS rather than fails, so a
# release gate would go green having never checked parity at all.
